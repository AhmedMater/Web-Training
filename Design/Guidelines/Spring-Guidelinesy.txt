	------------------
		1. Rest Resources: are Classes created in controller folder ex: CourseRes, LookupRes
		2. Services: are Classes created in services folder to perform Logic ex: CourseSer, LookupSer
		3. Repositories: are Classes created in repository folder to execute DB Queries ex: CourseRep, LookupRep
		
		4. Namings:	
			1. Classes: should be Capitalized ex (CourseRes, AttendanceSer, GradeRep, SecurityManager, ...)
			2. Functions & variables: should be Camelcase ex (courseService, stdList, courseData, findByID(), editCourse())
			3. Constants: should be uppercase (SPEED_OF_LIGHT, PI_VALUE, COURSE_PREFIX, ...)
			4. Namings should be meaningful (courseData, courseList, courseStdList, ...)
			5. Functions: (Controller - Service) getCourse, editCourse, createCourse, removeCourse
			6. Functions: (Repository) findCourse, updateCourse, insertCourse, deleteCourse
			7. Functions: (in CourseRep) -> findByID(), updateByID(), insert(), deleteByID(), findAll(), findStudentsByID()
		
		7. Rest Service Pathes: (in CourseRes)
			/ -------------------(GET)------------------> getAllCourses (with query Parameters)
			/ -------------------(POST)-----------------> createCourse (with Payload)
			/{courseID} ---------(GET)------------------> getCourseByID (with courseID as Path Parameter)
			/{courseID} ---------(PUT)------------------> editCourse (with courseID as Path Parameter)
			/{courseID}/students/ ----------------------> getAllCourseStds (with courseID as Path Parameter)
			/{courseID}/student/{stdID}/grades ---------> getStdGrades (with corID & stdID as Path Parameters)
			/{courseID}/student/{stdID}/attendance -----> getStdAttendance (with corID & stdID as Path Parameters)
		
		8. Model Folder: should be categories
			1. lookup/ -------> has all Model Classes of Lookups in the System
			2. lookup/rm -----> has all Row Mapper Classes for Selecting Lookups from Database
			3. course/ -------> has all Model Classes of Course in the System
			4. course/rm -----> has all Row Mapper Classes for Selecting Course from Database
			5. attendance/ -------> has all Model Classes of Attendance in the System
			6. attendance/rm -----> has all Row Mapper Classes for Selecting Attendance from Database
